# School and Standardized test analysis
I create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Background

Having spent years analyzing financial records for big banks, you've finally scratched your idealistic itch and joined the education sector. My latest role as Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I have been given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### District Summary

I have created a high-level snapshot, in a DataFrame, of the district's key metrics, including the following:

* Total schools
* Total students
* Total budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### School Summary

Then I have created a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school, including the following:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

After that I created a DataFrame that highlights the top 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)


### Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

Also I created a DataFrame that highlights the bottom 5 performing schools based on % Overall Passing. Include the following metrics:

* School name
* School type
* Total students
* Total school budget
* Per student budget
* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Math Scores by Grade

My next DataFrame lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Reading Scores by Grade

To match math I created a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.

### Scores by School Spending

I also took a look and created a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student). The following metrics are included in this Dataframe:

* Average math score
* Average reading score
* % passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
* % passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
* % overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

### Scores by School Size

Broke down school performance based on school size (small, medium, or large).
### Scores by School Type

Also broke down school performance based on type of school (district or charter).
